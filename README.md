# CFDeck
Here is my collection of CFD-related code. This set is developed mostly during an entry-level CFD course.


The 8 cases are:

- Airfoil Mesh
- Differential Error Test
- First Order Wave Equation
- Linear Burgers Equation
- Laplace Equation
- Method of Weighted Residuals
- Flow Around Circular Cylinder
- Lid Driven Cavity Flow

Short descriptions and comments are attached to the code and full reports are excluded from repository. Contact me in person if you want to get them.
